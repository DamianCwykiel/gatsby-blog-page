            <h3>My name is Damian and I am a progresive web developer and an archaeologist.
                I'm keen on a really good weather and animals - cats or penguins.
                I love to create and explore also a new places. I like to solve strange problems and just to have a good time building.
                I always enjoy learning new skills and possibilities.
                Except diving into front & back-end technology I like to relax gaming or chatting.
                I also am a big fun of archeology and architecture.
                I love to travel and go shopping.
                In the end of this text in conclusion I'm looking for a task that truly involves me.
                If you ain't extremely bored of this section and you like my website, contact me for more information.
